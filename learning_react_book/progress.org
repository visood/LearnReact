#+TITLE: Web Development
  Web development is really defined by the front-end. The back-end should be
  independent of how it's computations are used. There are innumerable ways of
  putting the back and front together, a bunch of philosophies out there. The
  best way to learn is to develop a full system. Here we make another attempt.

* Front End: React
  Components are central to React. A web page is composed of components. Every
  single unit is a component that is responsible for both what you see as well
  as any interactions that it may be have with other components of the app.

** Buttons
   React has =SyntheticEvent= for DOM events, but not all DOM events have a
   =SyntheticEvent= equivalent. If React does not recognize an event, you have
   to use =addEventListener=.
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   var Something = React.createClass({
     handleMyEvent: function(e) {
       //do something
     },
     componentDidMount: function()
     {
       window.addEventListener("someEvent", this.handleMyEvent);
     },
     componentWillUnmount: function() {
       window.removeEventListener("someEvent", this.handleMyEvent);
     },
     render: function() {
       return (
         <div>Hello!</div>
       );
     }
   });
